# Recognition-of-Handwritten-Digits-using-the-MNIST-Dataset
The aim of this project is to implement a classification algorithm (CNN MNSIT Classifier) to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äê 9). It has been shown in pattern recognition that no single classifier performs the best for all pattern classification problems consistently. An accuracy rate of 92.58% was achieved.
